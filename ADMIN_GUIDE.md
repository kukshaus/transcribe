## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set Up Your First Admin User

Run the admin setup script to make an existing user an admin:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd /path/to/your/transcribe/project

# Run the setup script with your email
node scripts/setup-admin.js your-email@example.com
```

**Example:**
```bash
node scripts/setup-admin.js admin@mycompany.com
```

### 2. Access the Admin Dashboard

1. Sign in with your admin account
2. You'll see an "Admin" link in the header (shield icon)
3. Click the Admin link or navigate to `/admin`
4. The dashboard will load with all user management features

## Usage Guide

### Viewing Users

1. **User List**: The left sidebar shows all users with their basic information
2. **User Selection**: Click on any user to view detailed information
3. **User Status**: Look for admin badges and inactive status indicators

### Managing User Information

1. **Edit User Details**: Click on a user and modify their information in the form
2. **Token Management**: Change token balance directly
3. **Admin Status**: Toggle admin privileges for other users
4. **Account Status**: Activate/deactivate user accounts

### Handling Payment Failures

1. **Payment Failure Form**: Use the form at the bottom of the admin dashboard
2. **Required Fields**:
   - User ID (copy from user list)
   - Tokens to Grant (number of tokens to compensate)
   - Reason (description of the payment failure)
   - Stripe Session ID (optional, for reference)
3. **Submit**: Click "Grant Tokens for Payment Failure" to process

### User Analytics

When you select a user, you can see:

- **Statistics**: Total transcriptions, completion rate, token usage
- **Recent Transcriptions**: List of user's transcription history
- **Spending History**: Detailed log of all token transactions

## API Endpoints

### Admin Users
- `GET /api/admin/users` - Get all users (admin only)
- `GET /api/admin/users/[id]` - Get specific user details (admin only)
- `PATCH /api/admin/users/[id]` - Update user information (admin only)

### Payment Failure Handling
- `POST /api/admin/payment-failure` - Grant tokens for payment failure (admin only)

## Security Considerations

### Admin Access Control
- Admin status is verified on every API request
- Non-admin users cannot access admin endpoints
- Admin status is stored in the database, not in session

### Token Management
- All token changes are logged in spending history
- Admin actions are tracked with descriptions
- Token balance updates are atomic operations

### Audit Trail
- All admin actions are logged
- Payment failure compensations are documented
- User changes are tracked with timestamps

## Troubleshooting

### "Admin access required" Error
- Make sure you've run the setup script with your email
- Verify your user has `isAdmin: true` in the database
- Check that you're signed in with the correct account

### User Not Found
- Verify the user ID is correct
- Check that the user exists in the database
- Ensure the user ID format is valid (24-character MongoDB ObjectId)

### Token Update Fails
- Check that the token amount is a valid number
- Verify the user exists and is active
- Look for any database connection issues

## Database Schema

### User Model Updates
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  isAdmin: boolean,        // Admin privileges
  isActive: boolean,        // Account status
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Spending History Updates
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  action: 'admin_token_grant' | 'admin_token_deduction' | 'payment_failure_compensation',
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Best Practices

### Admin Management
- Only grant admin access to trusted users

- Use admin features responsibly

### Token Management
- Document reasons for token grants/deductions
- Be consistent with compensation amounts
- Monitor token usage patterns

### Payment Failures
- Investigate payment failures thoroughly

- Keep detailed records of all compensations

### Security
- Never share admin credentials
- Log out when finished with admin tasks
- Monitor admin activity regularly
